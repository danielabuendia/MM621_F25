# Chapter 1 of DOET
**Why aren’t doors the simplest thing to use?** In daily life we keep finding small difficulties in objects that should be obvious, and doors are the perfect example. You push instead of pulling or the other way around, which makes no sense. Norman calls these unnecessary problems, and now we even say Norman doors. A door should be intuitive, not needing signs. But designers often prefer beauty over utility, and that’s when things get frustrating. What’s crazy is that sometimes useless but pretty designs still win prizes.

## Principles of good design
* Discoverability → know where actions are.
* Understanding → know what they mean. Design doesn’t need to sacrifice aesthetics for clarity. Too many controls = confusion, fewer controls = better learning.

## Human-Centered Design (HCD)
Products should be delightful, not just functional. Bad design forces users to adapt instead of the product adapting to them. Engineers often assume “common sense,” but everyone thinks differently. HCD puts human needs, behavior, and interaction first.

## Fundamental principles
### **Affordances:*** interaction between an object and a person, possible actions/depend on perception (birds crash into glass).

### * Signifiers: clues of what to do (popcorn button on microwave, fire alarm). More important than affordances.

### * Mapping: the relationship between controls and their results (seat recliner buttons).
### * Feedback: a way of letting you know the system is working on your request (com}}uter lights on when starting, low-battery warning).
### * Conceptual models: an explanation of how something works, that help us predict the effects of our actions(folders/files icons on a computer).

## Paradox of technology
Technology promises simplicity but adds complexity: watches now track heart rate, sleep, etc. More functions = more confusion.
